# Supply Chain Anomaly Detection Project Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure all aspects of the project are properly set up before finalizing.

## Project Structure

- [ ] All required directories are created:
  - [ ] `src/` with subdirectories for each component
  - [ ] `data/` with raw, processed, and sample subdirectories
  - [ ] `notebooks/` for Jupyter notebooks
  - [ ] `mlflow/` for MLflow utilities
  - [ ] `scripts/` for standalone scripts
  - [ ] `tests/` for test suite
  - [ ] `docs/` for documentation
  - [ ] `config/` for configuration files
  - [ ] `models/` for saved models

## Core Code

- [ ] All core modules are implemented:
  - [ ] `src/data/preprocess.py` - Data preprocessor
  - [ ] `src/models/anomaly_detection.py` - Anomaly detector
  - [ ] `src/models/issue_classification.py` - Issue classifier
  - [ ] `src/models/recommendation.py` - Recommendation generator
  - [ ] `src/visualization/visualize.py` - Visualizer
  - [ ] `src/models/sc_issue_detection.py` - Integration facade

- [ ] MLflow integration is implemented:
  - [ ] `mlflow/mlflow_utils.py` - MLflow utilities

## Scripts and Configuration

- [ ] Training script is implemented:
  - [ ] `scripts/train_model.py`

- [ ] Configuration files are created:
  - [ ] `config/model_params.yml`

## Project Files

- [ ] Project files are created:
  - [ ] `README.md` - Documentation
  - [ ] `setup.py` - Package installation
  - [ ] `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns

## Demo and Examples

- [ ] Demo notebook is created:
  - [ ] `notebooks/01_supply_chain_anomaly_detection_demo.ipynb`

- [ ] Sample data is available:
  - [ ] `data/sample/sample_supply_chain_data.csv`

## Git Setup

- [ ] Git repository is initialized
- [ ] `.gitignore` is properly configured
- [ ] All necessary directories have `.gitkeep` files
- [ ] Initial commit is created
- [ ] Remote repository is set up on GitHub
- [ ] All files are pushed to the remote repository

## Package Installation

- [ ] Package is installable with pip:
  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```
- [ ] All dependencies are properly listed in `setup.py`
- [ ] Package imports work correctly

## Testing

- [ ] Core functionality is tested
- [ ] Demo notebook runs without errors
- [ ] All imports work correctly
- [ ] Training script runs successfully
- [ ] MLflow tracking works if available

## Documentation

- [ ] README.md provides clear introduction and setup instructions
- [ ] Each module has proper docstrings
- [ ] Functions and methods have parameter documentation
- [ ] Demo notebook is well-documented with explanations

## MLflow Integration

- [ ] MLflow tracking works correctly
- [ ] Parameters are logged properly
- [ ] Metrics are logged properly
- [ ] Models are logged properly
- [ ] Artifacts (visualizations, dataframes) are logged properly
- [ ] Model registry functions work if enabled

## Databricks Compatibility

- [ ] Code works in Databricks environment
- [ ] Databricks-specific utilities are implemented
- [ ] Delta Lake integration works if used
- [ ] MLflow integration works with Databricks workspace

## Final Steps

- [ ] Run through the entire pipeline once more to ensure everything works
- [ ] Check for any hardcoded paths or parameters that should be configurable
- [ ] Ensure all TODOs and placeholders are addressed
- [ ] Update version number in setup.py
- [ ] Create a git tag for the release
- [ ] Push final changes to GitHub
